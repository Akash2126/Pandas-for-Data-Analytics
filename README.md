📊 Pandas for Data Analytics
🔹 Introduction
This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files covering various Pandas concepts essential for data analytics. Pandas is a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis, widely used in data science, machine learning, and financial analysis.

🔹 Importance of Pandas
✅ Data Handling – Efficiently manages large datasets using DataFrames & Series.
✅ Data Cleaning – Handles missing values, duplicates, and data transformation.
✅ Data Visualization – Integrates well with Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization.
✅ Performance – Optimized for fast computations on structured data.
✅ Ease of Use – Simple syntax for beginners and professionals.

🔹 Installation
To install Pandas, use the following command:


pip install pandas
If you're using Anaconda, Pandas is pre-installed. You can update it with:


conda update pandas
🔹 How to Use
1️⃣ Open Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook
2️⃣ Import Pandas in Python:


import pandas as pd
3️⃣ Read a CSV file:


df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
print(df.head())  # Display first 5 rows
🔹 Topics Covered
✔️ DataFrames & Series
✔️ Data Cleaning (Handling Missing & Duplicate Values)
